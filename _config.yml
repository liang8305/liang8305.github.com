# All Jekyll-Bootstrap specific configurations are namespaced into this hash
#
JB :
    version : 0.3.0

    # All links will be namespaced by BASE_PATH if defined.
    # Links in your website should always be prefixed with {{BASE_PATH}}
    # however this value will be dynamically changed depending on your deployment situation.
    #
    # CNAME (http://yourcustomdomain.com)
    #   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH
    #   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)
    #
    # GitHub Pages (http://username.github.com)
    #   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH
    #   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)
    #
    # GitHub Project Pages (http://username.github.com/project-name)
    #
    #   A GitHub Project site exists in the `gh-pages` branch of one of your repositories.
    #  REQUIRED! Set BASE_PATH to: http://username.github.com/project-name
    #
    # CAUTION:
    #   - When in Localhost, your site will run from root "/" regardless of BASE_PATH
    #   - Only the following values are falsy: ["", null, false]
    #   - When setting BASE_PATH it must be a valid url.
    #     This means always setting the protocol (http|https) or prefixing with "/"
    BASE_PATH : false

    # By default, the asset_path is automatically defined relative to BASE_PATH plus the enabled theme.
    # ex: [BASE_PATH]/assets/themes/[THEME-NAME]
    #
    # Override this by defining an absolute path to assets here.
    # ex:
    #   http://s3.amazonaws.com/yoursite/themes/watermelon
    #   /assets
    #
    ASSET_PATH : false

    # These paths are to the main pages Jekyll-Bootstrap ships with.
    # Some JB helpers refer to these paths; change them here if needed.
    #
    archive_path: /archive.html
    categories_path : /categories.html
    tags_path : /tags.html
    atom_path : /atom.xml

    # Settings for comments helper
    # Set 'provider' to the comment provider you want to use.
    # Set 'provider' to false to turn commenting off globally.

    # Settings for sharing helper.
    # Sharing is for things like tweet, plusone, like, reddit buttons etc.
    # Set 'provider' to the sharing provider you want to use.
    # Set 'provider' to false to turn sharing off globally.
    #
    sharing :
    provider : false

    # Settings for all other include helpers can be defined by creating
    # a hash with key named for the given helper. ex:
    #
    #   pages_list :
    #     provider : "custom"
    #
    # Setting any helper's provider to 'custom' will bypass the helper code
    # and include your custom code. Your custom file must be defined at:
    #   ./_includes/custom/[HELPER]
    # where [HELPER] is the name of the helper you are overriding.
